    /// Disable L1 sync. This is handy when:
    /// - You are running the full-node or gateay presets (sync-only node), but you do not have access to an L1 RPC node. You only want to sync
    ///   L2 blocks and serve the RPC and/or (feeder-)gateway protocols.
    /// - You are running a devnet, in which case this field is activated by default if you do not provide an `--l1-endpoint <RPC url>`, for convenience.
    /// - You are running a production chain that is intended not to settle on an L1 chain.
    ///
    /// In general, it is relatevely harmless to disable L1 sync when running sync-only nodes in chains that produce blocks very frequently.
    /// In more details, at time of writing, disabling L1 sync has the following consequences:
    ///
    /// ## RPC and Feeder Gateway block status
    ///
    /// - RPCs and the feeder gateway will not be able to return transaction and block status `ACCEPTED_ON_L1`.
    ///
    /// ## L1 to L2 messages
    ///
    /// - RPC getMessagesStatus (the RPC responsible to get the L2 transaction hashes and status from an L1 transaction hash) will not work.
    /// - When producing blocks, the node will not be able to produce transactions for L1 to L2 messages, because it can't fetch them.
    /// - L2 to L1 messages will still be able to be produced - although if you are running madara without the orchestrator, they will never reach L1.
    ///
    /// ## Gas prices
    ///
    /// The madara backend tracks the most recent `l1_gas_price` and `l1_blob_gas_price`. When disabling L1 sync, **these fields will be empty**, unless
    /// you use `--l1-gas-price <price>` and `--blob-gas-price <price>` to set them to a constant value. See their documentation for details.
    ///
    /// - When devnet mode is enabled these fields are empty, they will be initialized to zero for convenience.
    /// - When producing blocks, the block headers will be initialized with most recent value of these fields. If they are empty, **they will be initialized
    ///   with zeroes**.
    /// - When querying the pre-confirmed block, or when executing on top of it, and there is not currently one present, the RPC specification
    ///   requires us to return a "fake" pre-confirmed block with no transactions. In this case, the header of this *fake* block will be initialized
    ///   with most recent value of these fields. If they are empty, they will instead use the same value as in the most recent confirmed block header, and,
    ///   if there is not yet any confirmed block in the database - pre-genesis state - they will be initialized to zero.
    ///   This has an impact on:
    ///   - All RPCs returning blocks when asking for the pre-confirmed block.
    ///   - RPC execution endpoints, such as estimate_fee/estimate_message_fee/simulate_transaction.
    ///   - Transaction validation (rpc, but also gateway), in particular the gas prices used for fee checking.
    ///
    /// This last point is particularily important when the chain produces blocks very sparsely, as the fee estimations may be much more accurate when l1 sync
    /// is enabled.
