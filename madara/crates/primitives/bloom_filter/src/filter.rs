//! Bloom filter implementation with configurable hash functions and storage backends.
//!
//! A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element
//! is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not. In other
//! words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set."
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - Generic over hash functions
//! - Supports both thread-safe (atomic) and single-threaded storage backends
//! - Pre-calculated hash optimization for repeated queries
//! - Serialization support via serde

///
/// where:
/// - h1 is the primary hash value of the item
/// - h2 is a secondary hash derived from h1 using rotation and golden ratio multiplication
/// - m is the bit array size (applied implicitly by the caller)
/// - i iterates from 0 to k-1, with k being the number of desired hash functions
///
/// # Mathematical Justification
///
/// ## Double Hashing
/// - Double hashing is used to minimize clustering in Bloom filters.
/// - The choice of a secondary hash function (`h2`) prevents patterns from forming in hash placement.
/// - It ensures an **even and uniform spread** of bits, reducing collisions.
/// - Reference: [Kirsch & Mitzenmacher (2006) - "Less Hashing, Same Performance"](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/rsa2008.pdf)
///
/// ## Golden Ratio Constant (`0x9e37_79b9_7f4a_7c15`)
/// The function uses **PHI = 2^64/φ**, where `φ` is the golden ratio (~1.6180339887). This value is chosen because:
/// - It provides **optimal distribution properties** in hashing.
/// - When used in multiplication, it ensures **good bit avalanche effects**.
/// - Its **binary representation distributes bits uniformly**, preventing poor hash results.
/// - It minimizes **correlation between input and output bits** in modular arithmetic.
/// - Reference: [Knuth, D. (1998). "The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3"](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html)
///
/// ## Bit Rotation (`17`)
/// The **17-bit rotation** was selected because:
/// - It is **coprime with 64** (word size), ensuring maximum period length.
/// - Provides **effective bit mixing** while remaining computationally efficient.
/// - As an **odd number**, it avoids potential alignment patterns from even rotations.
/// - Creates a **balanced distribution** between upper and lower word bits.
///
/// The combination of **golden ratio multiplication** and **17-bit rotation** ensures **strong avalanche properties**
/// and **computational efficiency**.

/// Returns an iterator yielding `hash_count` different hash values. Each value
