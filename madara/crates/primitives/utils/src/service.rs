//! Madara Services Architecture
//!
//! Madara follows a [microservice](microservices) architecture to simplify the
//! composability and parallelism of its services. That is to say services can
//! be started in different orders, at different points in the program's
//! execution, stopped and even restarted. The advantage in parallelism arises
//! from the fact that each services runs as its own non-blocking asynchronous
//! task which allows for high throughput. Inter-service communication is done
//! via [tokio::sync] or more often through direct database reads and writes.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # The [Service] trait
//!
//! This is the backbone of Madara services and serves as a common interface to
//! all. The [Service] trait specifies how a service must start as well as how
//! to _identify_ it. For reasons of atomicity, services are currently
//! identified by a single [std::sync::atomic::AtomicU64]. More about this later.
//!
//! Services are started with [Service::start] using [ServiceRunner::service_loop].
//! [ServiceRunner::service_loop] is a function which takes in a future: this
//! future represents the main loop of your service, and should run until your
//! service completes or is cancelled.
//!
//! It is part of the contract of the [Service] trait that calls to
//! [ServiceRunner::service_loop] should not complete until the service has
//! _finished_ execution (this should be evident by the name) as this is used
//! to mark a service as complete and therefore ready to restart. Services where
//! [ServiceRunner::service_loop] completes _before_ the service has finished
//! execution will be automatically marked for shutdown as a safety mechanism.
//! This is done as a safeguard to avoid an invalid state where it would be
//! impossible for the node to shutdown.
//!
//! > **Note**
//! > It is assumed that services can and might be restarted. You have the
//! > responsibility to ensure this is possible. This means you should make sure
//! > not to use the like of [std::mem::take] or similar on your service inside
//! > [Service::start]. In general, make sure your service still contains all
//! > the necessary information it needs to restart. This might mean certain
//! > attributes need to be stored as a [std::sync::Arc] and cloned so that the
//! > future in [ServiceRunner::service_loop] can safely take ownership of them.
//!
//! ## An incorrect implementation of the [Service] trait
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use mp_utils::service::Service;
//! # use mp_utils::service::ServiceId;
//! # use mp_utils::service::PowerOfTwo;
//! # use mp_utils::service::ServiceRunner;
//! # use mp_utils::service::MadaraServiceId;
//!
//! pub struct MyService;
//!
//! #[async_trait::async_trait]
//! impl Service for MyService {
//!     async fn start<'a>(&mut self, runner: ServiceRunner<'a>) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//!         runner.service_loop(move |ctx| async {
//!             tokio::task::spawn(async {
//!                 tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::MAX).await;
//!             });
//!
//!             // This is incorrect, as the future passed to service_loop will
//!             // resolve before the task spawned above completes, meaning
//!             // Madara will incorrectly mark this service as ready to restart.
//!             // In a more complex scenario, this means we might enter an
//!             // invalid state!
//!             anyhow::Ok(())
//!         });
//!
//!         anyhow::Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl ServiceId for MyService {
//!     fn svc_id(&self) -> PowerOfTwo {
//!         MadaraServiceId::Monitor.svc_id()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## A correct implementation of the [Service] trait
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use mp_utils::service::Service;
//! # use mp_utils::service::ServiceId;
//! # use mp_utils::service::PowerOfTwo;
//! # use mp_utils::service::ServiceRunner;
//! # use mp_utils::service::MadaraServiceId;
//!
//! pub struct MyService;
//!
//! #[async_trait::async_trait]
//! impl Service for MyService {
//!     async fn start<'a>(&mut self, runner: ServiceRunner<'a>) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//!         runner.service_loop(move |mut ctx| async move {
//!             ctx.run_until_cancelled(tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::MAX)).await;
//!
//!             // This is correct, as the future passed to service_loop will
//!             // only resolve once the task above completes, so Madara can
//!             // correctly mark this service as ready to restart.
//!             anyhow::Ok(())
//!         });
//!
//!         anyhow::Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl ServiceId for MyService {
//!     fn svc_id(&self) -> PowerOfTwo {
//!         MadaraServiceId::Monitor.svc_id()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Or if you really need to spawn a background task:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use mp_utils::service::Service;
//! # use mp_utils::service::ServiceId;
//! # use mp_utils::service::PowerOfTwo;
//! # use mp_utils::service::ServiceRunner;
//! # use mp_utils::service::MadaraServiceId;
//!
//! pub struct MyService;
//!
//! #[async_trait::async_trait]
//! impl Service for MyService {
//!     async fn start<'a>(&mut self, runner: ServiceRunner<'a>) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//!         runner.service_loop(move |mut ctx| async move {
//!             let mut ctx1 = ctx.clone();
//!             tokio::task::spawn(async move {
//!                 ctx1.run_until_cancelled(tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::MAX)).await;
//!             });
//!
//!             ctx.cancelled().await;
//!
//!             // This is correct, as even though we are spawning a background
//!             // task we have implemented a cancellation mechanism with ctx
//!             // and are waiting for that cancellation in service_loop.
//!             anyhow::Ok(())
//!         });
//!
//!         anyhow::Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl ServiceId for MyService {
//!     fn svc_id(&self) -> PowerOfTwo {
//!         MadaraServiceId::Monitor.svc_id()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This sort of problem generally arises in cases similar to the above, where
//! the service's role is to spawn another background task. This is can happen
//! when the service needs to start a server for example. Either avoid spawning
//! a detached task or use mechanisms such as [ServiceContext::cancelled] to
//! await for the service's completion.
//!
//! Note that service shutdown is designed to be manual. We still implement a
//! [SERVICE_GRACE_PERIOD] which is the maximum duration a service is allowed
//! to take to shutdown, after which it is forcefully cancelled. This should not
//! happen in practice and only serves to avoid cases where someone would forget
//! to implement a cancellation check. More on this in the next section.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Cancellation status and inter-process requests
//!
//! Services are passed a [ServiceContext] as part of [ServiceRunner::service_loop]
//! to be used during their execution to check for and request cancellation.
//! Services can also start child services with [ServiceContext::child] to
//! create a hierarchy of services.
//!
//! ## Cancellation checks
//!
//! The main advantage of [ServiceContext] is that it allows you to gracefully
//! handle the shutdown of your services by checking for cancellation at logical
//! points in the execution, such as every iteration of a service's main loop.
//! You can use the following methods to check for cancellation, each with their
//! own caveats.
//!
//! - [ServiceContext::is_cancelled]: synchronous, useful in non-blocking
//!   scenarios.
//! - [ServiceContext::cancelled]: a future which resolves upon service
//!   cancellation. Useful to wait on a service or alongside [tokio::select].
//!
//! > **Warning**
//! > It is your responsibility to check for cancellation inside of your
//! > service. If you do not, or your service takes longer than
//! > [SERVICE_GRACE_PERIOD] to shutdown, then your service will be forcefully
//! > cancelled.
//!
//! ## Cancellation requests
//!
//! Any service with access to a [ServiceContext] can request the cancellation
//! of _any other service, at any point during execution_. This can be used for
//! error handling for example, by having a single service shut itself down
//! without affecting other services, or for administrative and testing purposes
//! by having a node operator toggle services on and off from a remote endpoint.
//!
//! You can use the following methods to request for the cancellation of a
//! service:
//!
//! - [ServiceContext::cancel_global]: cancels all services.
//! - [ServiceContext::cancel_local]: cancels this service and all its children.
//! - [ServiceContext::service_remove]: cancel a specific service.
//!
//! ## Start requests
//!
//! You can _request_ for a service to be restarted by calling
//! [ServiceContext::service_add]. This is not guaranteed to work, and will fail
//! if the service is already running or if it has not been registered to
//! [the set of global services](#service-orchestration) at the start of the
//! program.
//!
//! ## Atomic status checks
//!
//! All service updates and checks are performed atomically with the use of
//! [tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken] and [MadaraServiceMask], which is a
//! [std::sync::atomic::AtomicU64] bitmask with strong [std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst]
//! cross-thread ordering of operations. Services are represented as a unique
//! [PowerOfTwo] which is provided through the [ServiceId] trait.
//!
//! > **Note**
//! > The use of [std::sync::atomic::AtomicU64] limits the number of possible
//! > services to 64. This might be increased in the future if there is a
//! > demonstrable need for more services, but right now this limit seems
//! > high enough.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Service orchestration
//!
//! Services are orchestrated by a [ServiceMonitor], which is responsible for
//! registering services, marking them as active or inactive as well as starting
//! and restarting them upon request. [ServiceMonitor] also handles the
//! cancellation of all services upon receiving a `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`.
//!
//! > **Important**
//! > Services cannot be started or restarted if they have not been registered
//! > with [ServiceMonitor::with].
//!
//! Services are run to completion until no service remains, at which point the
//! node will automatically shutdown.

    ///
    /// - _blocking future_: this is blocking at a [Service] level, not at the
    ///   node level. A blocking task in this sense in a task which prevents a
    ///   service from making progress in its execution, but not necessarily the
    ///   rest of the node. A prime example of this is when you are waiting on
    ///   a channel, and updates to that channel are sparse, or even unique.
    ///
    /// - _entering an invalid state_: the entire point of [ServiceContext] is
    ///   to allow services to gracefully shutdown. We do not want to be, for
    ///   example, racing each service against a global cancellation future, as
    ///   not every service might be cancellation safe (we still do this
    ///   somewhat with [SERVICE_GRACE_PERIOD] but this is a last resort and
    ///   should not execute in normal circumstances). Put differently, we do
    ///   not want to stop in the middle of a critical computation before it has
    ///   been saved to disk.
    ///
    /// Putting this together, [ServiceContext::is_cancelled] is only suitable
    /// for checking cancellation alongside tasks which will not block the
    /// running service, or in very specific circumstances where waiting on a
    /// blocking future has higher precedence than shutting down the node.
    ///
    /// Examples of when to use [ServiceContext::is_cancelled]:
    ///
    /// - All your computation does is sleep or tick away a short period of
    ///   time.
    /// - You are checking for cancellation inside of synchronous code.
    ///
    /// If this does not describe your usage, and you are waiting on a blocking
